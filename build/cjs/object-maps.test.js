// how can I implement the above?
// can I even extract the locations from the schema?
// The first one is easy
// The power of this is that now "simplified" is an array of objects that is readable as an actionschema. If I can make this bi-directional it should be possible to work with openapis and jsonschemas from within actionschemas without having to make the nestedness.

//   openapiExample as unknown as OpenapiDocument,

// console.log(simplified);
