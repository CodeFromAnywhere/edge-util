   * # Limitations
   *
   * There's a big limitation: this syntax doesn't allow for optional folders like categories, something I did have before.
   *
   * To refactor everything to this new paradigm, we would need additional customisation capabilities, for example for finding ts source code and operations.
   * - We could do this with another parameter named `getStorageLocations`. This gives us full freedom, but this would also make things more complex.
   * - We could refactor operations and typescript code not to allow for categorisations, but this wout limit ourselves (but also simplify code and possibly reduce ambiguity)
   * - We might be able to create some sort of glob pattern support so we can add folders in this way with a double star (**) but it's not entirely clear how to do this in an efficient way.
